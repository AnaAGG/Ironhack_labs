# Lab | Discrete Probability Distributions


## Introduction

As a data analyst, you might need to use probability distribution for several reasons:

- To discover meaningful relationships between events.

- To make better data-driven decisions by answering questions like 'how likely something has happened out of pure coincidence'.

## Getting Started

Open `main.ipynb` in the `your-code` directory. There are exercises on Bernoulli's, binomial, and poisson distributions. In each exercise please read the question carefully and provide your solutions below the question. All the calculations must be performed using Python. Also please keep in mind that you might also need to use some of the functions you saw in the previous lessons. Please refer the notes. 

Happy Learning!!

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynbb` with your responses.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
