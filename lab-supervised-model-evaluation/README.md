# Lab | Supervised Learning Model Evaluation

## Introduction

In the Supervised Learning Model Evaluation lesson, we learned about a variety of model evaluation metrics that we could use to measure the performance of both regression and classification models. In this lab, we will practice calculating these metrics on regression and classification data sets.

## Getting Started

Open the `main.ipynb` file in the `your-code` directory. There are a bunch of questions to be solved. If you get stuck in one exercise you can skip to the next one. Read each instruction carefully and provide your answer beneath it.

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses to each of the exercises.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
