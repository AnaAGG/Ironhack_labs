# Lab | Unsupervised Learning Model Evaluation

## Introduction

In the Unsupervised Learning Model Evaluation lesson, we learned about different ways to evaluate unsupervised machine learning models. This lab is designed to help you practice the concepts covered in the lesson and solidify your ability to analyze the results of unsupervised models.

## Getting Started

Open the `main.ipynb` file in the `your-code` directory. There are a bunch of questions to be solved. If you get stuck in one exercise you can skip to the next one. Read each instruction carefully and provide your answer beneath it.

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses to each of the exercises.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
