# Lab | Subsetting and descriptive stats


## Introduction

As a data analyst you will have to work with a big amount of data. Extracting meaningful insights from your data can be done by dividing your data into subsets using Pandas library. It's a simple way to perform several type of analyses such as descriptive statistics.
In this lab, you will use Pandas library to extract insights from your data by dividing it into into several subsets. You might also need to use some Pandas descriptive statistics functions. 

## Getting Started

Open the `main.ipynb` file in the `your-code` directory. There are 3 exercises and in each exercise you will work with 3 different datasets. The datasets are in the same directory. Please keep in mind that you might also need to use some of the functions you saw in the previous lessons. Remember there is a common thread!! 

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
